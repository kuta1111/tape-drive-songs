In game command system:
First type !new playlist.
Then type names of songs you want to be in that playlist, each in different message.
(also all the names have to be exact copies of what is in songs file before the * symbol.)
After you are finished type !playlist finish.
There can also be premade playlists which you can edit in playLists file on github.
To then access those playlists you need to type !premade playlist after !new playlist then specify the name.

You might need to do !play after.
When a song is playing you can !stop, !play, !skip, !eject (it stops the tape and returns it to the begging, helps if you have an unwanted song at the begging of your tape).
You can also do !new playlist.

To add songs first upload then and then go to songs file and type: 
<name you type in game\>*<exact file name with all spaces replaced with %20>
