In game command system:
First type !new playlist.
Then type names of songs you want to be in that playlist, each in different message.
(also all the names have to be exact copies of what is in songs file before the * symbol.)
After you are finished type !playlist finish.
There can also be premade playlists which you can edit in playLists file on github.
To then access those playlists you need to type !premade playlist after !new playlist then specify the name.

You might need to do !play after.
When a song is playing you can !stop, !play, !skip, !eject (it stops the tape and returns it to the begging, helps if you have an unwanted song at the begging of your tape).
You can also do !new playlist.

To add songs first upload then and then go to songs file and type: 
<name you type in game\>*<exact file name with all spaces replaced with %20>

If you want me to build this in your base just give me coords or dislocator to your base and I'll build it when i get on next time.

If you want to build it yourself: copy "startup" file just like you did in nick's base ("copy startup disk/startup"), place tape drive on the left of your computer and put some long tape in it, put chat box on the right and put wireless modem on the back. Then put disk drive in front of it and put  the disk in, copy the file using "copy disk/startup startup" and hold ctr + r. You can destroy disk drive now.
